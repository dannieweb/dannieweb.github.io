### Who am I?

I've been hacking and programming since I was 10! I used to think programmers were so cool; go figure. By now I've been a professional web programmer for an additional 10 years, making 20 years total! See? I'm good at math, too!

I've removed some broken code (Testing for visible update in preview mode)
